# Rondelles packing 

Application for optimal cutting of rondelles. To enter the algorithm we get the height of the strip, the radius of the roundel, the minimum distance between the two adjacent rondelles and the minimum distance between the rondelle and the edges of the strip (distance below and above are the same, as well as from the beginning and end of the tape). The result of the algorithm is the maximum number of rondelles that can be cut from the entrance strip and the layout individual rolls. All input data should be in millimeters with the coordinate origin left bottom.
